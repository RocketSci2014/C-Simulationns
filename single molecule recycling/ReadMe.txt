This repository constains a simulation regarding a single molecule being recycled in a one-dimensional nanochannel. A new algorithm is developed to detect the emitting photons of a molecule during its passage through a laser beam, and thus to control the flow direction in the nanochannel and to reverse the molecule back to the laser beam. Such process would be carried out until the molecule bleaches.
